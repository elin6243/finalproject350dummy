Worked on: Circuit. Tried using an inverter to create a negative voltage, but that didn't help. The inverter just removed all of the voltage. 

Need to do: Find a way to create a negative voltage. Was planning on asking the TA on Monday how to do this. 

Plan on working on next: Verilog. I want to first fix my branches on my processor. Then I want to integrate io to the processor, as well as the audio and visual. 

Things to think about: I think we should have clear tasks for each of us to do. For example, I can focus more on Verilog, while you can focus on creating the sensors and the MIPS code.

Worked on: Sensor. Got the datasheet sensor working, and I got it to display .35V when I didn't touch the sensor and .7V when I did touch the sensor. Sadly though, the ADC converter output didn't change. But then I realized that the ADC converter slowly heated up and so it might've been shorted? I switched the ADC and checked the circuit but I couldn't find anything wrong. 

Understand how to create multiple sceens now. 

need to do: Find a way to do the sensor. Honestly, I think we should use buttons now and just find clever ways to measure "force" from the buttons. 

Plan on working next: Implement the multiple screens with functionality from the input.
