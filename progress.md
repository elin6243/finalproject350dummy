Worked on: Circuit. Tried using an inverter to create a negative voltage, but that didn't help. The inverter just removed all of the voltage. 

Need to do: Find a way to create a negative voltage. Was planning on asking the TA on Monday how to do this. 

Plan on working on next: Verilog. I want to first fix my branches on my processor. Then I want to integrate io to the processor, as well as the audio and visual. 

Things to think about: I think we should have clear tasks for each of us to do. For example, I can focus more on Verilog, while you can focus on creating the sensors and the MIPS code.
